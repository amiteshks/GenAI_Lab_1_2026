People who lived on the ground swore the city ran on lies; people who lived up there swore the ground wouldn’t survive without it. I’m Nil, a courier with a penchant for sarcasm and bad coffee, and I’ve seen Cirrus from both sides of the knotted rope that keeps it aloft: the streets below where the wind stung your cheeks and the balconies above where the air tasted like minted fear.\\n\\nCirrus didn’t pretend to be gentle about it, not in the mornings when the market bargained with the clouds and not at night when the wind-singers practiced their hymns in the wind-alleys. The city sat on a lattice of wind-crystal rails, a honeycomb of gleam and grit that glowed faintly with the breath of a million people. If the lattice failed, the whole thing would shudder and fall like a rotten fruit. If it thrived, it would drift until it found another field to pretend to own.\\n\\nI was on my way to the upper spire to deliver a package to Archon Mirth, the man who wore his arrogance like a cape and called it governance. The stairs were no longer a thing to ascend; you hired a sky-elevator with a polite snore and a weight limit you pretended to respect. The weaker who couldn’t pay rode the “groundless route,” a chain of cable cars that rattled and complained to anyone who would listen.\\n\\nThe market mid-layer was a carnival of contradictions. Below, the air smelled of wet stone and stubborn earth. Above, the air smelled of varnished windows and the stubborn vanity of those who hadn’t stood on ground in years. Everyone wore a thread of silver in their hair—the official sign that “you belong to the air,” though the actual meaning was closer to “you’ve accepted the price of staying up.” They paid with stories, with promises, with a debt their grandchildren would owe to the wind.\\n\\nThe Archon’s tower rose like a pale spear in the distance, and I could tell something was off the moment I stepped into the hall. The guards wore smiles like masks; the clerk’s ledger sang under the light as though it were alive. They always wanted you to hear the sound of their prosperity before you saw the creaks. The Archon sat there, a man who knew he looked good and insisted on the credit that came with it. His words came slow, polished, and completely empty when it mattered.\\n\\n“Nil,” he said, “delivered truths taste better when they’re wrapped in silence.” He had a way of saying things that left a sour aftertaste, the kind you only notice after you swallow.\\n\\n“Truths don’t good-time themselves into your hands,” I said. “They walk in, knock, and demand your attention. And you, Archon, are late to your own seat at history’s table.”\\n\\nHe raised a yellowing eyebrow—some archons prefer to show age like a badge of honor—then waved me toward the window. Beyond the glass, Cirrus leaned closer to the edge of nothing, its balconies jutting like chipped teeth. The wind-chimes sang a tune only the wind could understand.\\n\\n“Your package,” the Archon said, flattening a letter with the emblem of the city—an abstract wing, as if the thing itself could fly if it wore the right insignia. “Take it to the observatory. The wind-singers will know what to do with it.”\\n\\nThe observatory was a cathedral to air: domes, rings, and a centerpiece called the Spine, a massive column of steel and glass that thrummed when the wind gusted. The wind-singers were a chorus of people who could coax the lattice into a higher pitch, which in turn made the city rise or settle with a sigh. Their voices were not merely musical; they were the mechanism’s heartbeat.\\n\\nOn the way, I overheard a few syllables that didn’t belong to the market’s polite noise. A couple of the wind-singers whispered about the “quiet adjustments” being made to the Great Lift—the master loom that kept Cirrus hovering where it pleased. They spoke of confidence and fear like two siblings competing for the most attention. And someone—one of the city’s more heroic cynics—muttered a joke about the air being practically a public utility and everyone paying a monthly “breath tax.” The laughter that followed was the city’s pressure valve. It released nothing, but it relieved the mood.\\n\\nThe package contained a simple letter with a seal I hadn’t seen outside of museums: a request to delay a major maintenance operation, or perhaps to reconsider the city’s schedule for the next quarter. It was not a political bomb—no banners, no marching drums—but it carried the scent of trouble all the same.\\n\\nAt the observatory, the Spine hummed with a quiet thunder. The wind-singers wore robes that fluttered regardless of wind; their faces showed only the most pleasant possible expression, because the city’s safety depended on everyone looking like they owned both air and destiny.\\n\\nThat’s when the truth came easier than a punchline.\\n\\n“We’re draining more air from below,” one singer admitted, a girl with a reckless smile and hair that seemed to vibrate with the lattice’s rhythm. “The Lift needs more ballast—so the upper districts can breathe sky. It keeps the balance.”\\n\\nI didn’t blink. “You’re pumping air from the poor to keep the rich from noticing your knees crack?”\\n\\nThe girl’s smile faded into something more honest. “It’s a balance. The city won’t hold if the lower plates tilt.” The word tilt sounded mild, but it carried the weight of a city’s survival.\\n\\nThe Archon appeared behind us, as if summoned by the word tilt itself. “The balance,” he repeated, with the reverence of someone reciting a bedtime fable to a child who already knows the ending.\\n\\nFrom there, the mood thickened. The architects, the guards, the wind-singers—all these pieces of Cirrus’s body began to move with a different rhythm. It was as if the city had learned a new beat, one that wasn’t written in any ledger. Someone had decided to tune Cirrus to a different song, and the song’s chorus was fear disguised as necessity.\\n\\nI didn’t like fear when it wore a tailor-made suit. It prided itself on appearing calm while carrying a very loud knife. So I did what I do best: I talked to people who didn’t have a stake in the decision, people who spoke plainly and wore dust on their boots instead of silk on their collars.\\n\\nOn the stairs down, a ground-dweller—one of the many who kept the lower city’s engines running with stubborn grit—stopped me with a look like he’d smelled something rotten and decided to follow the scent to the end. “They’re selling air,” he said. “Air they promise won’t be taxed, air they pretend is endless, air you’ll pay in silence and still lose when the city finally lands.” His words had the sting of a verdict.\\n\\nThe truth, which I don’t mind admitting I’d known for a while, is that Cirrus City lived on a pretended physics: a gravity that could be coaxed by a polite society into ignoring its own uneven weight. The people up top wore crowns of glass; those below wore the price of breath. The city rose because the engines were fed by the belief that it could be kept from falling, while the engines were kept running by the fear of what would happen if it did.\\n\\nWhen the storm came—an uneasy, violent gust that slapped the sky and made the lattice sing in protest—the city’s answers became louder than its questions. The Archon declared urgent maintenance; the wind-singers promised they could ride the gust if only the lower balconies would “consent to a brief, temporary adjustment.” The plan would tilt Cirrus toward the direction of the storm, letting the upper rings weather the worst, but the lower rings would lose their breath, their people, their lives.\\n\\nI stood on the observatory steps and did something I’m not proud of: I whispered into the air, a spoken rumor aimed not at the wind but at the city’s conscience. I told Cirrus what I’d learned in the market and on the stairs, what I’d watched when the letter burned its paper edge in a private flame inside my bag. I told Cirrus that if it chose to survive by stealing air from its own heart, it would become a ghost of a city, a rumor with a body and a breath that never quite reached its own lungs.\\n\\nThe city didn’t crash. It didn’t dissolve into a puddle of cloud or fall to earth in a single, clean sentence. Instead, Cirrus shifted. Some segments drooped. Others rose higher than their own design justified. The storm raged and the lattice trembled like a chorus that’d spent too long rehearsing in a crowded room. And in the tremor’s wake, I found something I hadn’t expected: the people began to talk to each other—really talk, not inflate each other’s stories. They compared notes, shared the costs, and began to demand accountability for the air they made.\\n\\nCirrus City, stubborn as a cat and twice as misled, kept hovering. It was a city that would rather drift than confront, that would rather pretend the ground didn’t bear its weight than admit the weight mattered. And perhaps that is why I stayed, despite that bitter edge of satisfaction that accompanies a good insult: because a city floating on vanity is a city that can be guided by a single, honest line spoken in a crowded corridor.\\n\\nWhen I finally left the observatory, the wind-singers still practiced their songs, the Market still traded rumors as if they were currency, and the Archon still wore his smile like a suit of armor. But somewhere in the wild, stubborn glow of Cirrus’s lanterns, people began to realize that the city wouldn’t stay up forever by mere habit and threat. It would stay up only if they refused to let it rely on fear, if they stopped paying for air with the breath of the ones who couldn’t afford to lose theirs.\\n\\nSo I drifted away, with a shrug and one last bite of sarcasm on my lips. Cirrus City floats because it can, because we all pretend it won’t fall until the last breath escapes us. And as long as we pretend, it will, too.\\n\\nIf there’s a lesson in it, it’s simple and ugly and true: even a sky-city is a city of mouths, and mouths are cheap until you’re too heavy to keep afloat. Cirrus will drift as long as the people choose to keep it airborne.
